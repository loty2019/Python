The RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) cryptosystem is widely used for secure communication in browsers, bank ATM machines,
credit card machines, mobile phones, smart cards, and operating systems. It works by manipulating integers. To thwart
eavesdroppers, the RSA cryptosystem must manipulate huge integers (hundreds of digits), which is naturally supported by
the int data type in Python.
